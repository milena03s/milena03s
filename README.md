Hi! ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡

My name is Milena and I'm a CS student at Federal Center for Technological Education (CEFET-RJ), at Rio de Janeiro - Brazil .
-  I’m interested in Python, automation, and making life a bit easier both for my colleagues and myself :)
-  I’m currently learning gamification techniques and AI-powered learning.
-  How to reach me: Here's my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milena-soares-2b4758220/) profile!
-  Pronouns: she/her
  
### Projects I've made at college in colaboration with others: 
 - A Computational Vision software for hand gestures, called [Sentinela](https://github.com/noemicho/sentinela);
 - An [Anime Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/ErichJohann/Anime_Dataset_Analysis);
 - And some smaller [python challenges](https://github.com/milena03s/MeusDesafiosRamoIEEE) for a bigger project coming soon.

Stay tuned for more! ( • ᴗ - ) ✧
